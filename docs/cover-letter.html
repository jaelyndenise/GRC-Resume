        <h3>Security engineering · Software development · Solution-focused problem solving</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a Compliance Risk Analyst with a strong foundation in security engineering, software development, and data-driven risk assessment. 
          My work centers on helping organizations strengthen security posture, align with industry frameworks, and make clear, defensible decisions.
          I aim to deliver effective solutions that balance security, usability, business needs, regulatory requirements, user experience, and cost.
          I accomplish this by integrating systems that work with existing processes and tools, minimizing disruption while maximizing impact.
          I’m especially motivated by teams committed to innovation, data security, and operational excellence across all industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recent projects include comprehensive risk assessments using models such as the Carnegie Risk Maturity Model to identify vulnerabilities,
          deliver actionable recommendations, and produce tailored reports for executive and technical stakeholders. I troubleshoot complex issues,
          collaborate across functions to design efficient solutions, and keep customers informed at every step.
        </p>

        <p>
         My hands-on experience in full stack software development directly complements my work in cybersecurity engineering and compliance. 
         Because I can code across the stack, I not only understand how applications are built but can also dive into source code to identify 
         potential security gaps and recommend secure design patterns. This technical depth enables me to collaborate effectively with developers, 
         guide teams from initial coding through secure deployments, and integrate compliance requirements seamlessly into the development process. 
         Paired with my background in risk assessments and the delivery of education and training, I provide end-to-end support that strengthens 
         security, improves compliance, and empowers teams to build safer systems.
        </p>

        <ul class="highlights">
          <li>Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities; analyze logs/metrics to surface risk trends.</li>
          <li>Develop concise reports and narratives that inform business and compliance decisions.</li>
          <li>Manage security processes and incident workflows with clear stakeholder communication.</li>
          <li>Continuously upskill to track emerging threats and evolving regulatory expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with this role and how I can contribute to our team’s success.
