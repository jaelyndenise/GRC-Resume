          <!--Why am I passionate about web-development? What are some of my hobbies outside of technology?-->
            <p>I first started programming in the fall of 2018. A friend of mine is contracted with the city of Austin as a cybersecrity specialist and I've always been good at math, science and engineering so she suggested I pursue a career in technology. Thus, a nerd was born and the rest is history. Outside of technology.</p>
            
            <p><b>Some of the things I enjoy outside of technology are:</b></p>
