              <h3>A certified fast learner!</h3>
              <p>My name is Jaelyn Denise and I am a professional singer, cybersecurity professional,
                and mother of a 2 year old cane corso named Aero. I am from the foggy 
                mountains of Crestline, CA, but I spent most of my childhood wandering the forests in
                Southern Alabama.
              </p>
              <p>I love gardening, building castles in Minecraft, and taking afternoon cat naps.
                Over the years I've gradually grown my rubber ducky collection to a staggering 137
                pieces. My favorite color is midnight blue with sparkles - think, galaxy!
              </p>
              <p>I've traveled extensively the past several years and enjoy and appreciate the life 
                that I've been blessed with. Being able to spend my days solving problems, spending time 
                with family and exploring new cities is truly a dream come true!

            <p>My passions and interest have taken me on quite the journey, but one thing that has remained consistent,
              is my love of learning, creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. I believe that with hard work and dedication,
              all things are possible. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow myself both personally and professionally,
